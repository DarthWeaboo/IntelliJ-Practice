        <h1>Ways to Make Education Better</h1>
        <h2>Early Development</h2>
        <p>
            There are many ways to improve education around the world. One thing that is important to realize, is that children's growth starts very early in their life. This means improving preschool programs or implementing quality child care services is an important step in making sure children have the best start possible.
        </p>
        <h2>Quality and Safety of Schools</h2>
        <p>
            Keeping schools safe is among the top concerns relating to bettering education. Reducing violence and potential risk allows kids to have a safe place to learn, grow, and make key relationships that will benefit them for years to come.
        </p>
        <p>
            Better education also starts with obtaining quality teachers. Setting up teacher friendly programs can attract great teachers, which in turn sets up children the best education they can receive. 
        </p>
        <h2>School After School</h2>
        <p>
            Studies have shown that students with positive after school programs do better in the classroom and stay away from crime, and other negative factors, setting them on the right path. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This also encourages parents to get more involved in their child's education. The degree of a child's success has been shown to be directly related to their parents involvement. This gives students even more resources that they can take advantage of to get on the right path and a greater education.
