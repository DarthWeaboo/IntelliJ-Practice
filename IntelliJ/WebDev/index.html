        <h3>Too Many People</h3>
        <p>Hello everyone, welcome to Education Matters. Here I will be sharing information on how bettering children's education will create a better future for all of us. Enjoy your stay.</p>
        <h4 style="text-decoration: underline; font-variant: small-caps;">The Facts About Education</h4>
        <p>This site will explain to you the plentiful benefits that go along with bettering education for children. This of course extends to older students looking onward to college. Studies have shown that individuals who attend college earn more than <b>twice</b> as much as high school graduates. <i>Unfortunately</i>, not everyone has the opportunity to attend college due to the steadily increasing prices.</p>
        <p>Not only that but individuals who attend college are employed at higher rates and with greater consistency. This leads to things such as having more <b>assets including homes, cars, and investments.</b> It is easy to see through just a few statistics how much better education can affect the lives of young children and adults.</p>
